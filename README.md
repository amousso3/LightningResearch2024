# Lightning Research 2024

This repository houses the code used to answer the research question:

**Assessing the regional and temporal controls of lightning in various regions**

using data collected from the ERA5 Reanalysis dataset, the GOES Geostationary
Lightning Mapper dataset, and the GOES Advanced Baseline Imager dataset.
